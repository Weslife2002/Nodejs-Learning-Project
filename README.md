<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.

### Prerequisites

We need an app to manage Apache and MySQL service, in my case, I chose lampp for its simpplicity.

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
